But, if the work of doctors and their staff is a little bit easier can help them in huge lengths. So, we continued our Leprosy Project ahead with the creation of a mobile application that can identify the Leprosy type of the patient by taking a photo of the affected part of the skin. This system uses Deep-Learning Models for classification & provides high accuracy for the identification. ",
